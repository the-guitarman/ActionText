= action_text

In Webapplications, Rails-apps or other Content-Management-systems often you have to deal with Strings. But, 
in most cases, you have to write many little helper functions for formatting, validations, searches, and so on. 
In fact, you want your Strings to behave as if they were Texts! A Text is not just an array of characters
(this is what a String is meant to be!), it has a common structure, even punctuation (which matters!). Do you have to mess
with webcrawlers to find nasty duplicated content? Or a limited database where redundant records matters? Or simply want
to count the words in a Text? If you are using such kind of "Text"-Strings or functionality often, have a look which functionality ActionText 
offers to you: 
- Build nice looking sentences from ugly formatted strings.
- Check if other strings or even words or whole sentences are included in the text. 
- compare texts for similarity (not just equality!). Very useful if you don't want texts
  that are too similar! In addition, you can fluently set the degree of accuracy. 
- Ask the text if it is a valid type, eg. if it is a valid email-adress or url. 
- As this gem is developed for usage in Germany, of course the german 'umlauts' are handled
  naturally.
